Getting financially stable before you get married is always a good idea. \n\nUnderstand that financial hardship has an impact on your relationship. You don't want to start a marriage in hardships. Once you get married, conflicts may arise because of money constraints. Marriage adds new expenses that you may not be aware of. \n\nHence, we recommend you to wait even if you are growing old till your combined income is sufficient to cover your basic needs.",

This builds trust and makes what you are about to present easier to absorb. \n\nThen talk about your unmet expectations, focusing mostly on where you are coming from and how it would make you quite happy. Once you are done, let your partner speak freely. They may react positively or negatively. Either way, listen attentively and resist the urge to stop them. \n\nIf the discussion doesn't proceed as planned, apologize and mention we can discuss this later.

            "When you find it hard to listen to your partner, sit down. Try placing your hands on your lap or the table with your palms facing up. Continue to listen without moving your palms. \n\nKeeping your palms open subconsciously makes you more willing to accept what the other person is saying. It'll help ground you and make it easier to listen to your partner.",

            "When we are not listening and feeling restless, often our partner can notice this long before we realise this ourselves. \n\nNext time when your partner notices this, have a protocol where your partner utters a code word such as 'yellow apples'. Choose a code word that we rarely use. This code word immediately makes you self aware of your restlessness while your partner is speaking. This gives you an opportunity to be a better listener and not interrupt. \n\nOnce you are done with the conversation, don't forget to thank your partner for what they have done.",

            "Another technique to make it easier to listen is to count from 1 to 10 using your fingers. Stay at each finger for 3 seconds and then fold them one by one. It'll help you calm down and listen to your partner better. Interestingly, this technique also works in a reverse situation. If you notice your partner is getting irritated while you are speaking, stop speaking and then do the finger counting where they can clearly see your fingers folding. After this, either of you can start speaking to continue the conversation.",

Mention the emotions you felt in each situation. For example, 'My partner said no to a movie date. This is the third time they said no. I felt deeply hurt.' Recognize that them saying no is a trigger. Feeling hurt is your reaction to that trigger.\n\nList at least 10 such situations. It may take you 2-3 days to write them all down. The next time you face a similar trigger, resist the temptation to react. Tell yourself 'I feel this strong emotion'. Wait for 5 seconds before reacting or walking away, whichever feels more comfortable. In this way, you can control your negative emotions and improve the quality of your life.",

            "A healthy relationship requires many things to be right. You need to get 3 puzzles right - you, your partner and time. We often underestimate the amount of change involved. \n\nFirstly, you need to know what you want from your relationship. You need to know how much to adjust to make it work. \n\nSecondly, once you have a partner, you need to learn to accept their quirks and qualities you don't like.\n\nLastly, time and life constantly present us with new challenges we don't yet understand. For e.g. your partner loses their job and gets a new one in another city, you as a couple realize that you can't have children for whatever reasons. You can never be fully prepared for changes until they happen. Hence, it's healthy to accept that change is constant and we can never be completely prepared.",

Most of us don't pay attention to subtle signs in our facial expressions, tone of voice, body language etc. to recognise how someone is feeling. \n\nWhen we are feeling low and don't express, it  would result in pent-up emotions, and eventually causes an emotional outburst. This is not healthy. \n\nSo, it is essential to express your feelings directly. You need to express it in the right way at the right time.",

I understand that you have a busy schedule but I expected you to prioritize me over your work, especially on our anniversary'. \n\nHaving this discussion will help them understand your stance and accept your feelings more easily.

Mention the emotions you felt in each situation. For e.g, 'My partner said no to a movie date. This is the third time they said no. I felt irritated.' Recognize that them saying no is a trigger. Feeling irritated is your reaction to that trigger.\n\nList at least 10 such situations. It may take you 2-3 days to write them all down. \n\nThe next time you face a similar trigger, resist the temptation to react. Tell yourself 'I feel this strong emotion'.

You can say, 'In my family, we proactively remember and celebrate each other's birthdays and anniversaries'. I just want you to know I felt hurt when you couldn't make time to have dinner with me. I understand that you have a busy schedule but I expected you to prioritize me over your work, especially on our anniversary'. \n\nHaving this discussion will help them understand your stance and accept your feelings more easily.

Mention the emotions you felt in each situation. For e.g, 'My partner said no to a movie date. This is the third time they said no. I felt irritated.' Recognize that them saying no is a trigger. Feeling irritated is your reaction to that trigger.\n\nList at least 10 such situations. It may take you 2-3 days to write them all down. \n\nThe next time you face a similar trigger, resist the temptation to react. Tell yourself 'I feel this strong emotion'. Wait for 5 seconds before reacting or walking away, whichever feels more comfortable. \n\nIn this way, you can control your negative emotions and improve the quality of your life.",

            "Another technique to make it easier to listen is to count from 1 to 10 using your fingers. Stay at each finger for 3 seconds and then fold them one by one. It'll help you calm down and listen to your partner better. Interestingly, this technique also works in a reverse situation. If you notice your partner is getting irritated while you are speaking, stop speaking and then do the finger counting where they can clearly see your fingers folding. After this, either of you can start speaking to continue the conversation.",

Choose a code word that we rarely use. This code word immediately makes you self aware of your restlessness while your partner is speaking. This gives you an opportunity to be a better listener and not interrupt. \n\nOnce you are done with the conversation, don't forget to thank your partner for what they have done.",

This helps you control negative emotions. \n\nTake a moment to reflect back on when you felt angry or irritated, and what triggered those feelings. Note down these situations. Mention the emotions you felt in each situation. For e.g, 'My partner said no to a movie date. This is the third time they said no. I felt irritated.' Recognize that them saying no is a trigger. Feeling irritated is your reaction to that trigger.\n\nList at least 10 such situations. It may take you 2-3 days to write them all down. \n\nThe next time you face a similar trigger, resist the temptation to react. Tell yourself 'I feel this strong emotion'. Wait for 5 seconds before reacting or walking away, whichever feels more comfortable. \n\nIn this way, you can control your negative emotions and improve the quality of your life.",
